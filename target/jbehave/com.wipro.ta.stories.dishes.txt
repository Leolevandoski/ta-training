Scenario: With a collection without any removals the application should calculate the coefficient using all dishes
Examples:
Given the collection '<dishes>' with each value representing a dish
When I calculate the solution
Then the coefficient should be '<coefficient>'

|dishes|coefficient|
|1,2,3|14|
|-1,3,4|17|
|2,7,1|19|

Example: {dishes=1,2,3, coefficient=14}
Given the collection '1,2,3' with each value representing a dish
When I calculate the solution
Then the coefficient should be '14'

Example: {dishes=-1,3,4, coefficient=17}
Given the collection '-1,3,4' with each value representing a dish
When I calculate the solution
Then the coefficient should be '17'

Example: {dishes=2,7,1, coefficient=19}
Given the collection '2,7,1' with each value representing a dish
When I calculate the solution
Then the coefficient should be '19'
