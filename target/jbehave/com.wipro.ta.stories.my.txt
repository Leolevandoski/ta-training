Scenario: 
Examples:
Given a set of dishes '<list>'
When I calculate its coefficient
Then the coefficient is '<coefficient>'

|list|coefficient|
|[-1, 3, 4]|17|
|I want to be able remove some dishes, in which case, a new coefficient is calculated using the left dishes.||

Example: {list=[-1, 3, 4], coefficient=17}
Given a set of dishes '[-1, 3, 4]'
When I calculate its coefficient
Then the coefficient is '17' (FAILED)
(java.lang.AssertionError: Values should be different. Actual: 17)

Example: {list=I want to be able remove some dishes, in which case, a new coefficient is calculated using the left dishes., coefficient=}
Given a set of dishes 'I want to be able remove some dishes, in which case, a new coefficient is calculated using the left dishes.' (FAILED)
(com.google.gson.JsonSyntaxException: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Expected BEGIN_ARRAY but was STRING at line 1 column 1 path $)
When I calculate its coefficient (NOT PERFORMED)
Then the coefficient is '<coefficient>' (NOT PERFORMED)


Scenario: 
Examples:
Given a set of dishes '<list>'
When I remove some dishes '<removeDish>'
Then the coefficient is '<coefficient>'

|list|removeDish|coefficient|
|[-1, -9, 0, 5, -7]|[-9, -7]|14|

Example: {list=[-1, -9, 0, 5, -7], removeDish=[-9, -7], coefficient=14}
Given a set of dishes '[-1, -9, 0, 5, -7]'
When I remove some dishes '[-9, -7]'
Then the coefficient is '14'
