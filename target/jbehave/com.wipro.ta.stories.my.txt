Scenario: The solution must calculate the maximum sum of all possible Like-to-time coefficients.
Examples:
Given a collection of dishes '<list>'
When evaluate coefficient of the dishes
Then the coefficient of the list should be equals '<coefficient>'

|list|coefficient|
|[-1,11,56]|189|

Example: {list=[-1,11,56], coefficient=189}
Given a collection of dishes '[-1,11,56]'
When evaluate coefficient of the dishes
Then the coefficient of the list should be equals '189'


Scenario: I want to be able remove some dishes, in which case, a new coefficient is calculated using the left dishes.
Examples:
Given a collection of dishes '<list>'
When I delete dishes '<deleteDishes>'
When evaluate coefficient of the dishes
Then the coefficient of the list should be equals '<coefficient>'

|list|deleteDishes|coefficient|
|[-1,-9,0,5,-7]|[-9,-7]|14|

Example: {list=[-1,-9,0,5,-7], deleteDishes=[-9,-7], coefficient=14}
Given a collection of dishes '[-1,-9,0,5,-7]'
When I delete dishes '[-9,-7]'
When evaluate coefficient of the dishes
Then the coefficient of the list should be equals '14'
