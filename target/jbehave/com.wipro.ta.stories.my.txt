Scenario: Check that solution returns the correct coeffient for a valid input of dishes when dishes are not removed
Examples:
Given a collection of dishes '<list>'
When evaluate coefficient of the dishes
Then the coefficient of the list should be equals '<coefficient>'

|list|coefficient|
|[-1,3,4]|17|

Example: {list=[-1,3,4], coefficient=17}
Given a collection of dishes '[-1,3,4]'
When evaluate coefficient of the dishes
Then the coefficient of the list should be equals '17'


Scenario: I want to be able to remove some dishes, in wich case, a new coefficient is calculated
Examples:
Given a collection of dishes '<list>'
And I remove dishes '<removedDishes>'
When evaluate coefficient of the dishes
Then the coefficient of the list should be equals '<coefficient>'

|list|removedDishes|coefficient|
|[-1,-9,0,5,-7]|[-9,-7]|14|

Example: {list=[-1,-9,0,5,-7], removedDishes=[-9,-7], coefficient=14}
Given a collection of dishes '[-1,-9,0,5,-7]'
And I remove dishes '[-9,-7]'
When evaluate coefficient of the dishes
Then the coefficient of the list should be equals '14'
