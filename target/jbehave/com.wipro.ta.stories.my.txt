Scenario: The solution must calculate the maximum sum of all possible Like-to-time coefficients.
Examples:
Given a collection of <dishes>
When I calculate the coefficient of the given dishes
Then the coefficient should be <coefficient>

|dishes|coefficient|
|[-1,3,4]|17|

Example: {dishes=[-1,3,4], coefficient=17}
Given a collection of [-1,3,4]
When I calculate the coefficient of the given dishes
Then the coefficient should be 17


Scenario: I want to be able remove some dishes, in which case, a new coefficient is calculated using the left dishes.
Examples:
Given a collection of <dishes>
And calculate their coefficient
When I remove a number of dishes <numdishes>
And I calculate the coefficient of the given dishes
Then the coefficient should be <coefficient>

|dishes|numdishes|coefficient|
|[-1,-9,0,5,-7]|[-9, -7]|14|

Example: {dishes=[-1,-9,0,5,-7], numdishes=[-9, -7], coefficient=14}
Given a collection of [-1,-9,0,5,-7]
And calculate their coefficient
When I remove a number of dishes [-9, -7]
And I calculate the coefficient of the given dishes
Then the coefficient should be 14
