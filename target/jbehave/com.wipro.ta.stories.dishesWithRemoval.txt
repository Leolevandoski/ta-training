Scenario: With two collections, one representing all dishes, and other with dishes to be removed, the coefficient
must be calculated without considering the removed ones
Examples:
Given the collection '<dishes>' with each  value representing a dish
And having the '<removedDishes>' removed
When I calculate the solution
Then the coefficient should be '<coefficient>'

|dishes|removedDishes|coefficient|
|1,2,4,6|4|23|
|-1,-9,0,5,-7|-9,-7|14|
|2,4,1,0,8,9|1,0,8|37|

Example: {dishes=1,2,4,6, removedDishes=4, coefficient=23}
Given the collection '1,2,4,6' with each  value representing a dish
And having the '4' removed
When I calculate the solution
Then the coefficient should be '23'

Example: {dishes=-1,-9,0,5,-7, removedDishes=-9,-7, coefficient=14}
Given the collection '-1,-9,0,5,-7' with each  value representing a dish
And having the '-9,-7' removed
When I calculate the solution
Then the coefficient should be '14'

Example: {dishes=2,4,1,0,8,9, removedDishes=1,0,8, coefficient=37}
Given the collection '2,4,1,0,8,9' with each  value representing a dish
And having the '1,0,8' removed
When I calculate the solution
Then the coefficient should be '37'
