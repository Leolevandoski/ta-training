Scenario: The solution must calculate the maximum sum of all possible Like-to-time coefficients.
Examples:
Given a collection of <list>
When the coefficient is calculated
Then the value should be equals to <result>

|list|result|
|[-1,3,4]|17|

Example: {list=[-1,3,4], result=17}
Given a collection of [-1,3,4]
When the coefficient is calculated
Then the value should be equals to 17


Scenario: I want to be able remove some dishes, in which case, a new coefficient is calculated using the left dishes.
Examples:
Given a collection of <list>
When Removed <remove>
And the coefficient is calculated
Then the value should be equals to <result>

|list|remove|result|
|[-1,-9,0,5,-7]|[-9, -7]|14|

Example: {list=[-1,-9,0,5,-7], remove=[-9, -7], result=14}
Given a collection of [-1,-9,0,5,-7]
When Removed [-9, -7]
And the coefficient is calculated
Then the value should be equals to 14
