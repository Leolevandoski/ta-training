Scenario: Solution must be returns Like-to-time coefficient to be maximum
Examples:
Given a collection '<list>'
When calculate coefficient of the dishes
Then the coefficient should be equals to '<coefficient>'

|list|coefficient|
|[-1,3,4]|17|

Example: {list=[-1,3,4], coefficient=17}
Given a collection '[-1,3,4]'
When calculate coefficient of the dishes
Then the coefficient should be equals to '17'


Scenario: I want to be able remove some dishes, in which case, a new coefficient is calculated using the left dishes
Examples:
Given a collection '<list>'
When remove some dishes '<listRemove>'
When calculate coefficient of the dishes
Then the coefficient should be equals to '<coefficient>'

|list|listRemove|coefficient|
|[-1,-9,0,5,-7]|[-9,-7]|14|

Example: {list=[-1,-9,0,5,-7], listRemove=[-9,-7], coefficient=14}
Given a collection '[-1,-9,0,5,-7]'
When remove some dishes '[-9,-7]'
When calculate coefficient of the dishes
Then the coefficient should be equals to '14'
