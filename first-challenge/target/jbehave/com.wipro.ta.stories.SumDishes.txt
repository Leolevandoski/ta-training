Scenario: The solution must calculate the maximum sum of all possible Like-to-time coefficients.
Examples:
Given a collection of <dishes>
When the coefficient is calculated
Then the value must be <coefficient>

|dishes|coefficient|
|[-1,3,4]|17|

Example: {dishes=[-1,3,4], coefficient=17}
Given a collection of [-1,3,4]
When the coefficient is calculated
Then the value must be 17


Scenario: I want to be able remove some dishes, in which case, a new coefficient is calculated using the left dishes.
Examples:
Given a collection of <dishes>
And calculate coefficient
When I remove <removeNums>
And the coefficient is calculated
Then the value must be <coefficient>

|dishes|removeNums|coefficient|
|[-1,-9,0,5,-7]|[-9, -7]|14|

Example: {dishes=[-1,-9,0,5,-7], removeNums=[-9, -7], coefficient=14}
Given a collection of [-1,-9,0,5,-7]
And calculate coefficient
When I remove [-9, -7]
And the coefficient is calculated
Then the value must be 14
