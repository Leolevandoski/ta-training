Scenario: The solution must calculate the maximum sum of all possible Like-to-time coefficients.
Examples:
Given the amount of <dishes>
When the coefficient are calculated
Then the coefficient is equal to <coefficientResult>

|dishes|coefficientResult|
|[-1,7,4]|17|

Example: {dishes=[-1,7,4], coefficientResult=17}
Given the amount of [-1,7,4]
When the coefficient are calculated
Then the coefficient is equal to 17 (FAILED)
(java.lang.AssertionError: expected:<17> but was:<25>)


Scenario: I want to be able remove some dishes, in which case, a new coefficient is calculated using the left dishes.
Examples:
Given the amount of <dishes>
And the coefficient calculated
When some dishes are <removed>
And the coefficient are calculated
Then the coefficient is equal to <coefficientResult>

|dishes|removed|coefficientResult|
|[-1,-9,0,5,-7]|[5, -7]|14|

Example: {dishes=[-1,-9,0,5,-7], removed=[5, -7], coefficientResult=14}
Given the amount of [-1,-9,0,5,-7]
And the coefficient calculated
When some dishes are [5, -7]
And the coefficient are calculated
Then the coefficient is equal to 14 (FAILED)
(java.lang.AssertionError: expected:<14> but was:<0>)
