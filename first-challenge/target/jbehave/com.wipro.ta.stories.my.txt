Scenario: The solution must calculate the maximum sum of all possible Like-to-time coefficients.
Examples:
Given a collection of dishes '<list>'
When check coefficient of the dishes
Then the coefficient of the list should be equals '<coefficient>'

|list|coefficient|
|[-1,3,4]|17|

Example: {list=[-1,3,4], coefficient=17}
Given a collection of dishes '[-1,3,4]'
When check coefficient of the dishes
Then the coefficient of the list should be equals '17'


Scenario: I want to be able remove some dishes, in which case, a new coefficient is calculated using the left dishes.
Examples:
Given a collection of dishes '<list>'
When I remove dishes '<removeDishes>'
When check coefficient of the dishes
Then the coefficient of the list should be equals '<coefficient>'

|list|removeDishes|coefficient|
|[-1,-9,0,5,-7]|[-9,-7]|14|

Example: {list=[-1,-9,0,5,-7], removeDishes=[-9,-7], coefficient=14}
Given a collection of dishes '[-1,-9,0,5,-7]'
When I remove dishes '[-9,-7]'
When check coefficient of the dishes
Then the coefficient of the list should be equals '14'
