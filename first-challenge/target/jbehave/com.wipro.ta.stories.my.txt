Scenario: Check that solution returns correct coefficient for a valid input of dishes are not removed
Examples:
Given a collection of dishes'<list>'
When evaluate coefficient of the dishes
Then the coefficient of the list should be equals '<coefficient>'

|list|coefficient|
|[-1,3,4]|17|

Example: {list=[-1,3,4], coefficient=17}
Given a collection of dishes'<list>' (PENDING)
When evaluate coefficient of the dishes (NOT PERFORMED)
Then the coefficient of the list should be equals '17' (NOT PERFORMED)
@Given("a collection of dishes'<list>'")
@Pending
public void givenACollectionOfDisheslist() {
  // PENDING
}



Scenario: I want to be able remove some dishes, in which case, a new coefficient is calculated using the left dishes.
Examples:
Given a collection of dishes'<list>'
When I remove dishes '<removeDishes>'
When evaluate coefficient of the dishes
Then the coefficient of the list should be equals '<coefficient>'

|list|removeDishes|coefficient|
|[-1, -9, 9, 0, 5, -7]|[-9, -7]|14|

Example: {list=[-1, -9, 9, 0, 5, -7], removeDishes=[-9, -7], coefficient=14}
Given a collection of dishes'<list>' (PENDING)
When I remove dishes '[-9, -7]' (NOT PERFORMED)
When evaluate coefficient of the dishes (NOT PERFORMED)
Then the coefficient of the list should be equals '14' (NOT PERFORMED)
@Given("a collection of dishes'<list>'")
@Pending
public void givenACollectionOfDisheslist() {
  // PENDING
}
