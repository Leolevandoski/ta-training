Scenario: I want to be able remove some dishes, in which case, a new coefficient is calculated using the left dishes.
Examples:
Given some '<dishesList>'
And calculate their coefficient
When I remove dishes '<removeNums>'
And I calculate coefficient
Then coefficient is '<coefficient>'

|dishesList|removeNums|coefficient|
|[-1,-9,0,5,-7]|[-9, -7]|14|

Example: {dishesList=[-1,-9,0,5,-7], removeNums=[-9, -7], coefficient=14}
Given some '[-1,-9,0,5,-7]' (FAILED)
(com.google.gson.JsonSyntaxException: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Expected BEGIN_ARRAY but was STRING at line 1 column 8 path $.list)
And calculate their coefficient (NOT PERFORMED)
When I remove dishes '[-9, -7]' (NOT PERFORMED)
And I calculate coefficient (NOT PERFORMED)
Then coefficient is '<coefficient>' (NOT PERFORMED)


Scenario: The solution must calculate the maximum sum of all possible Like-to-time coefficients.
Examples:
Given some '<dishesList>'
When I calculate coefficient
Then coefficient is <coefficient>

|dishesList|coefficient|
|[-1,3,4]|17|

Example: {dishesList=[-1,3,4], coefficient=17}
Given some '[-1,3,4]' (FAILED)
(com.google.gson.JsonSyntaxException: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Expected BEGIN_ARRAY but was STRING at line 1 column 8 path $.list)
When I calculate coefficient (NOT PERFORMED)
Then coefficient is 17 (NOT PERFORMED)
