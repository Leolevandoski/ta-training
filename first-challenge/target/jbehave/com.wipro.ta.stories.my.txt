Scenario: Check that solution calculate the maximum sum of all possible Like-to-time coefficients.
Examples:
Given some dishes '<list>'
When I calculate coefficient
Then coefficient is <coefficient>

|list|coefficient|
|[-1,3,4]|17|

Example: {list=[-1,3,4], coefficient=17}
Given some dishes '[-1,3,4]'
When I calculate coefficient
Then coefficient is 17


Scenario: I want to be able remove some dishes, in which case, a new coefficient is calculated using the left dishes.
Examples:
Given some dishes '<list>'
And calculate their coefficient
When I remove dishes <removeNums>
And I calculate coefficient
Then coefficient is <coefficient>

|list|removeNums|coefficient|
|[-1,-9,0,5,-7]|[-9, -7]|14|

Example: {list=[-1,-9,0,5,-7], removeNums=[-9, -7], coefficient=14}
Given some dishes '[-1,-9,0,5,-7]'
And calculate their coefficient
When I remove dishes [-9, -7]
And I calculate coefficient
Then coefficient is 14
