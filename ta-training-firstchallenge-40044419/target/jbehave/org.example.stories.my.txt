Scenario: As a user, I want to the total Like-to-time coefficient to be maximum for the dishes.
Examples:
Given I receive the value of dishes '<field>'
When I calculate the solution
Then I shall see the coeffient: '<coeffient>'

|field|coeffient|
|1,2,3|14|
|-1,3,4|17|
|-1,-9,0,5,-7|14|

Example: {field=1,2,3, coeffient=14}
Given I receive the value of dishes '1,2,3'
When I calculate the solution
Then I shall see the coeffient: '14'

Example: {field=-1,3,4, coeffient=17}
Given I receive the value of dishes '-1,3,4'
When I calculate the solution
Then I shall see the coeffient: '17'

Example: {field=-1,-9,0,5,-7, coeffient=14}
Given I receive the value of dishes '-1,-9,0,5,-7'
When I calculate the solution
Then I shall see the coeffient: '14'
