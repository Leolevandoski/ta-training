Narrative:
As an user
I want to add and remove items from a cart

Scenario: Creating cart by adding a product
Given no cart
When I add '$product' to a cart's products
Then I should get a cart with a single product in it
Examples:
| product |
| { "description": "description", "id": 18, "value": 10, "weight": 10 } |

Scenario: Remove item from cart with known items
Given cart with populated with the following product ids: '$productIds'
When I remove the product with id '$id' from the cart
Then cart no longer contains product '$id'
Examples:
| n | productIds |
| 2 | 2, 5, 7    |

Scenario: Create cart with new products then remove one
Given a new cart with the following products '$products'
When I remove the first item from created cart
Then cart has one less element
Examples:
| products |
| ["{ \"description\": \"p1\", \"id\": 0, \"value\": 11, \"weight\": 11 }", "{ \"description\": \"p2\", \"id\": 0, \"value\": 12, \"weight\": 12 }" ] |

Scenario: Calculate cart total
Given a new cart with the following products '$products'
When I get cart
Then response has '$total' as the total
Examples:
|total | products |
| 23 | ["{ \"description\": \"p1\", \"id\": 0, \"value\": 11, \"weight\": 11 }", "{ \"description\": \"p2\", \"id\": 0, \"value\": 12, \"weight\": 12 }" ] |

Scenario: Calculate shipping
Given a new cart with the following products '$products'
When I calculate shipment for created cart with '$request'
Then shipment was calculated  and total weight is '$weight'
Examples:
|weight | request | products |
|23 | {"cep":"81520-300", "serviceType":"SEDEX_VAREJO"} | ["{ \"description\": \"p1\", \"id\": 0, \"value\": 11, \"weight\": 11 }", "{ \"description\": \"p2\", \"id\": 0, \"value\": 12, \"weight\": 12 }" ] |
